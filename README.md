# Deliveroo app clone

This react-native app is a clone of the existing deliveroo app frontend. It was created using `npx create-expo-app` and it uses the sanity cms to manage content.



## Starting the project:
1. Check if you have node and npm installed by running `node -v`. If you get an error you need to install node (https://nodejs.org/en/download).
2. Run `npm install` in the root folder of the project.
3. To start up the local dev server run `npx expo start` and open the *Expo go* app on your phone or the simulator by pressing `i` (ios) or `a` (android) to preview the app (You need to install Xcode or Android studio to use the simulators)
